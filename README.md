# P1-Implementation-Of-MLModel-For-Image-Classification-
 in This project, I focuses on the implementation of a machine learning model for image classification using deep learning techniques. 
 It leverages popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras (or PyTorch) to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images into predefined categories. 
 In The project i includes steps for dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It's designed to be easily customizable for various image classification tasks and is ready for 
 deployment with features for predicting new images. In this project I use Streamlit, Streamlit is an open-source app framework that allows you to quickly build interactive web applications 
 for machine learning and data science projects. In this project, Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface where users can upload images and interact with the trained image 
 classification model.
